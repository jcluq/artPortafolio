This artwork can be described through a very simple instruction: twenty dice are rolled at the same time. If the result of all dice is not the number one, they are rolled again. When the desired result is obtained, the machine stops. With this work, I created a system that ultimately speaks about hope, anticipatory consciousness, the complications embedded in the idea of possibility, and how durability becomes crucial to any form of material resistance. When possibility meets improbability, duration and resistance become matters of time.

By building this machine, I aim to explore how we act and perform around the idea of hope in improbable scenarios. Whether shaped by personal experience or through observation of the world, I find the act of hoping deeply human—perhaps irrational at times, yet central to who we are.
I wanted to stage a temporal condition in which a machine is set to achieve a clearly defined, possible goal, but under the burden of an extremely low probability. The process unfolds through mechanical repetition acting upon physical objects. With each dice roll, the machine asserts itself in time, conducting an action toward its goal. Yet the odds are stacked against it: the machine becomes caught in an iterative loop, unlikely to reach the desired outcome within any foreseeable timeframe.

If the machine continues running long enough, it may eventually succeed. But statistically speaking, it is far more likely that something else—mechanical fatigue, external interference, or environmental decay—will end the process first. In this way, the piece invites contemplation of what it takes to persist against the improbable.

To ground this in figures: the probability of rolling twenty ones simultaneously with fair six-sided dice is (1/6)²⁰, which is approximately 1 in 3.66 quintillion. This number is almost incomprehensibly large. To make this intuitive, consider the estimated number of grains of sand on Earth—around 7.5 quintillion. Imagine being blindfolded and asked to pick out a specific, pre-selected grain of sand from every beach, desert, and riverbed on the planet. The chance of doing so successfully on your first try would be of the same order as rolling twenty ones in one attempt.
Philosopher Ernst Bloch speaks of anticipatory consciousness—the sense that things could, or should, be otherwise. As temporal beings, we live in the tension between what is and what might be. We act in the present because we anticipate a possible future. In Bloch’s terms, this drive is what constitutes hope. We hope, therefore we act.

This is where the machine becomes a foil to human experience. Unlike us, it has no agency, no lived temporality beyond its programmed behavior. It cannot shift the odds, nor can it reflect on its task. It simply repeats. And in this, the passivity of its hopeful outcome becomes tragic—it will either achieve the goal or break down trying.

The work stages a metaphor for our own relation to hope: when we cease to act meaningfully within the conditions of improbability, we risk becoming trapped in endless cycles—passive participants in the unfolding of time.
The title While Hope speaks to this layered temporality. The word while evokes simultaneity—something happening as something else unfolds. It marks an active present suspended in anticipation. While hope becomes an abstraction of the now, a continuous state of persistence in the face of uncertainty.
