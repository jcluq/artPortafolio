title: The Persistance of Constancy
slug: tpoc

This installation stages a minimal but persistent interaction: water is condensed from the surrounding air and slowly directed, drop by drop, onto the surface of a rock. Over time—potentially years, decades, or even longer—this action is intended to cause erosion, a process that is usually imperceptible within the span of a human life.

At the core of the system is a hollow copper coil, continuously cooled by water maintained at 0°C. The temperature difference between the coil and the ambient air causes moisture to condense on the copper's surface, mimicking natural dew formation. The collected water is channeled and released with rhythmic precision, striking the stone with quiet inevitability.

This piece stages a scenario of transformation governed not by force, but by endurance. It echoes the way natural forces—wind, water, time—act on matter through slow repetition. By isolating and exhibiting such a process within the context of an artwork, the installation renders visible what would otherwise remain unseen: the shaping power of consistency.

Where While Hope operates in the domain of chance and improbability, The Steadiness of Constancy offers a meditation on certainty. The process here is not random but deterministic: if the parameters are held, the transformation will happen. Yet the pace of change is so gradual that it challenges our ability to perceive it. This shift from uncertainty to inevitability also reflects a movement from existential questioning toward a kind of philosophical patience.

The installation touches on what philosopher Henri Bergson called durée—a qualitative, lived experience of time that differs from mechanical, quantifiable time.1 It reminds us that duration is not always dramatic, but can be quietly relentless. Through repetition, the invisible becomes legible; through constancy, matter yields.

This work also reflects on our relationship to geological or cosmological time—scales that dwarf human activity and resist narrative. Erosion is not an event but a condition: it is always happening, though rarely seen. In this sense, the installation invites a contemplation of deep time,2 where agency is slow, and transformation becomes a matter of persistence rather than force.
