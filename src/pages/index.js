              I am an artist and maker from Bogota, Colombia with a deep
              interest in installation, sculpture, physical computation and
              digital fabrication.<br></br>
              <br></br>I like to work with perceptually interesting
              technologies, objects and phenomena by figuring out ways to
              transform them into experiences and contraptions that can express
              what I consider special about the complexity of the world we live
              in. <br></br>
              <br></br>I also have experience doing introductory workshops,
              using strategies to teach about art, electronics, programming and
              digital fabrication in a horizontal way. I believe the sharing of
              knowledge is the basis for a better future.
